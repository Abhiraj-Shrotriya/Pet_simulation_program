    "In this method, a new Pet type record ```pet``` is created. Then using dot notation, each field of the record is assigned a copy of the value stored at some index inside the String type array ```petInformationArray``` given to the method as an argument. The name of the pet is stored at index 0 of this array, so index 0 is accessed and a copy of the value is assigned to the ```name``` field of the record ```pet```. The pet's species is stored at index 1 of the array so a copy of the value at index 1 is assigned to the ```species``` field of the record ```pet```. The happy level of the pet is stored at index 2 of the array as a String, so it is accessed and converted to an integer using the ```Integer.parseInt``` method. The result value is subtracted by a happy level decrease factor (```happyLevelDecreaseFactor```) and then this final value is assigned to the ```happyLevel``` field of the record ```pet```. \n",
